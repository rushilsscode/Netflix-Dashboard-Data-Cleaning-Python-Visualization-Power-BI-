## 📝 Introduction  

**Project on Netflix Data Analysis** — I imported the raw dataset into **VS Code** and cleaned it using **Python**, handling missing values, standardizing columns, and removing duplicates.  
After preprocessing, I exported the cleaned data and imported it into **Power BI** to build an interactive dashboard with KPIs, trend indicators, and Netflix-themed visuals that explore:  
- Content distribution  
- Top genres  
- Release year trends  
- Country-level insights

- **Pandas:** A powerful data analysis library used for cleaning, organizing, and transforming the Netflix dataset. It helped handle missing values, remove duplicates, and perform data exploration efficiently using DataFrames.  

- **NumPy:** A numerical computing library that provided fast operations on large datasets. It was mainly used for performing mathematical calculations and converting duration data into minutes.  

- **Matplotlib:** A visualization library used to create informative charts such as pie and bar graphs. It helped in visually representing key insights like content type distribution, top countries, and overall trends in Netflix data.

## 📥 Data Loading  

The dataset was imported directly from an online source using **Pandas**.  
It was accessed from the **TidyTuesday GitHub repository**, which provides weekly datasets for data analysis practice.
