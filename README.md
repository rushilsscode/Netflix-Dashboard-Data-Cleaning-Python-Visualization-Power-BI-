## Introduction  
Project on Netflix data analysis — I imported the raw dataset into **VS Code** and cleaned it using **Python** (handled missing values, standardised columns, removed duplicates). Then I exported the cleaned data and imported it into **Power BI** to build an interactive dashboard with KPIs, trend indicators and Netflix-theme visuals that explore content distribution, top genres, release trends and country-level insights.

## Tools Used  
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Data Visualization & BI:** Power BI  
- **Data Cleaning & Preparation Environment:** VS Code + Jupyter Notebook  
- **Dataset:** Netflix Titles (movies & TV shows)

-Pandas: A powerful data analysis library used for cleaning, organizing, and transforming the Netflix dataset. It helped handle missing values, remove duplicates, and perform data exploration efficiently using DataFrames.

-NumPy: A numerical computing library that provided fast operations on large datasets. It was mainly used for performing mathematical calculations and converting duration data into minutes.

-Matplotlib: A visualization library used to create informative charts such as pie and bar graphs. It helped in visually representing key insights like content type distribution, top countries, and overall trends in Netflix data.

## Key Questions & Insights  
- What’s the ratio of movies to TV shows, and how has that changed over the years?  
- Which countries produce the most content on Netflix?  
- What genres dominate the catalog, and how are they distributed globally?  
- How have release volumes changed year by year?  
- Derived KPIs with trend indicators to showcase growth/decline over time.
