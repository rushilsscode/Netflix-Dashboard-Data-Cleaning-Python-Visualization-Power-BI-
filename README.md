 # 🎬 Netflix Dashboard – Data Analysis & Visualization Project

## Introduction  
Project on Netflix data analysis — I imported the raw dataset into **VS Code** and cleaned it using **Python** (handled missing values, standardized columns, removed duplicates). Then I exported the cleaned data and imported it into **Power BI** to build an interactive dashboard with KPIs, trend indicators and Netflix-theme visuals that explore content distribution, top genres, release trends and country-level insights.

## Tools Used  
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Data Visualization & BI:** Power BI  
- **Data Cleaning & Preparation Environment:** VS Code + Jupyter Notebook  
- **Dataset:** Netflix Titles (movies & TV shows)

## Key Questions & Insights  
- What’s the ratio of movies to TV shows, and how has that changed over the years?  
- Which countries produce the most content on Netflix?  
- What genres dominate the catalog, and how are they distributed globally?  
- How have release volumes changed year by year?  
- Derived KPIs with trend indicators to showcase growth/decline over time.
